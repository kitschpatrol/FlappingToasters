Flapping Toasters
=================
Developed by Michael Edgcumbe and Eric Mika in March 2011.
A final project for ITP's 3D Sensing and Visualization class.

Notes
=====
Uses a Kinect + OpenNI skeleton tracking to detect arm flapping.

Built with openFrameworks 0062

Compiled against gameoverhack's fork of ofxOpenNI:
https://github.com/gameoverhack/ofxOpenNI/commit/a1ec3ffea09bdbd644e57cc9f5c2a1c20a65f02c

Should work on Linux / Windows, but I haven't tested and don't have IDE project files for those platforms. Sorry.

Inclues ofxControlPanel, which requires the ofxDirList addon.

Xcode project file is for Xcode 4.

Binaries are Intel-only, for Mac OS X 10.6.

Interaction
===========
You embody a flying toaster. Strike the psi pose to get calibrated, and then start flapping. Tilt in either direction to do a barrel roll. Clap to release toast. Supports multiple players.

Interface
==========
Tab toggles the GUI
K toggles the Kinect window
F toggle full screen mode

Problems
========
- Sometimes ofxOpenNI freezes the keyboard on my laptop. External keyboards work fine. The rest of the machine continues to work fine.

- Startup is slow. This is getting better with subsequent revisions of ofxOpenNI, but don't lose hope if it takes forever to start.

- Initial wing flapping animation is glitchy until the flap-detection system has enough data to automatically calibrate itself.

Thanks

Thanks to Kyle McDonald and Zach Lieberman for creating the 3DSAV class.

Thanks to Wagner for the music.

Big thanks to After Dark for their brilliant and twisted screen savers (and for kindly refraining from suing us).
